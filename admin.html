          The Mirror of Feelings is a live, interactive theatrical experience
          designed to help elementary school students recognize, understand, and

          storytelling, music, movement, and direct audience participation,
          children learn that all emotions are valid, and that they always have a
          choice in how they respond to what they feel.

            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>
              The play follows two friends, <strong>Danny</strong> and
              <strong>Sam</strong>, as they prepare a birthday surprise that
              doesn't go exactly as planned.
            </p>
            <p>
              What starts as excitement slowly turns into moments of anxiety,
              anger, sadness, and eventually joy. As emotions become bigger and
              harder to manage, a magical character &mdash;
              <strong>The Mirror of Feelings</strong> &mdash; comes to life.
            </p>
            <p>The Mirror helps the characters pause and reflect on what they are feeling, guiding them step by step to:</p>
            <ul class="check-list">
              <li>Notice what is happening in their bodies</li>
              <li>Observe facial expressions</li>
              <li>Name emotions correctly</li>
              <li>Explore healthy ways to express those emotions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The situations in the play are intentionally relatable to children's
              daily lives: school pressure, making mistakes, forgetting important
              things, disappointment, and celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the end of the play, children understand that emotions are not
              something to fear or suppress, but
              <em>signals that can guide them when handled properly</em>.

              Danny is energetic, cheerful, and deeply caring. He wants everything

              Danny, children learn how <strong>anxiety</strong> feels in the body

              The Mirror is a magical, friendly guide who senses emotions and helps
              children understand them. Rather than naming feelings for the
              characters, the Mirror encourages <strong>self-discovery</strong>,
              reinforcing the idea that everyone is responsible for identifying and
              expressing their own emotions.

              Sam is curious, expressive, and sometimes impulsive. He experiences
              anger, sadness, and joy &mdash; learning that even heavy emotions can be
              released in healthy ways such as movement, hugging, or sharing with
              trusted adults.

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>
              Children experience strong emotions daily, especially in school
              environments &mdash; during exams, social interactions, mistakes,
              surprises, and changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without proper tools, emotions often turn into behavioral challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Mirror of Feelings addresses this need by teaching emotional
              intelligence in a way that is:
            </p>
            <ul class="check-list">
              <li>Concrete</li>
              <li>Memorable</li>
              <li>Engaging</li>
              <li>Developmentally appropriate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The play aligns with
              <strong>Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)</strong> principles and
              supports schools in building emotionally healthy learning
              environments.
